### Summary
Today's Definition of Done:
- Navigation to a site's page index
- Abot to Edit my "about" page
- Auto-slug implemented where slug is filled based on title.
- Refreshing a subdomain reflects changes immediately 

### Work Session
It's Wednesday again so I was in a bit of a rush to get this done and get to church on time. I implemented pages for edit and create along with a delete method that has a popup confirmation.  This is all very similar to what I did in day 7 for sites but it's for pages that belong to sites now.

Instead of pasting the code blocks in the work session body like I have been doing I'm just going to leave the link to the commit at the end incase anyone is interested.  

###  Recap 
The commit for todays session is [commit acfa87a](https://github.com/fjoenichols/RhizomeCMS/commit/acfa87a1ea55c55163e013f7f2778a1b82396dd5).
